## Introduction

In order to use our data in downstream applications such as Truffle/Structure and the pedigree reconstruction, vcf files from each primate research center were combined into one file (for faster data annotation - `bcftools merge` was used). That combined file is named `all_nprcs.vcf.gz`. The next step was to remove unneded annotation from the files. This step was completed using bcftools.
